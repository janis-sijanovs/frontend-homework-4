# Frontend Homework 4

I have completed my fourth homework. 

What a homework it was. We only had one day between lessons to do the homework.
I had daily life stuff to do during the day, so I did the homework at night.

This homework involves using Flexbox Grid classes. Especially when you're sleepy, having CSS in classes instead of them being in CSS is extremely confusing.
I start getting lost, not remembering what has a flexbox grid and what doesn't have one.

I tried using the mobile-first approach for this one too. I just felt like it would work better with flexbox grid, 
since it uses min-width for media queries.

I also made the burger, but it's not very fancy, just a hidden checkbox. If I had more time, 
I could've added some animations and a better design for the navigation.

In the end, the whole design ended up very messy, with a few unnecessary helper classes and a bunch of random margins.
There are no color variables and mixins, even though a lot of text classes have the same properties, so would be easily reusable, 
but as I said, the time and thinking capacity for this homework was limited, so just threw them in there as is.

I feel like flexbox grid isn't really for me, even though now I better understand how it works,
writing all the stuff manually fits my thinking style better.

Now it's time to get at least a little bit of sleep before the lessons begin.
